## DESCRIPTION

A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which there is a path between any two nodes. A node with no edges is itself a connected component. This benchmark computes number of connected components in an undirected graph.

## BUILD

Run make in the root directory or in the source folder (e.g. apps/cc)

## RUN

Execute as: ./cc [-o output-file] <undirected-graph-file>

e.g., ./cc -o outfile.txt road-USA.sgr
